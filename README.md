# PowerBI_SQL_Analysis

## Project Overview
The PowerBI_SQL_Analysis project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data using Power BI and SQL Server. The objective is to derive actionable insights and trends that can inform business decisions and strategies for optimizing pizza sales.

## Data Sources
The primary data source for this project is:
[pizza_sales.csv](https://github.com/sumaiyamahmud/PowerBI_SQL_Analysis/files/14046829/pizza_sales.csv)

## Tools

- **Excel:** Used for initial data exploration and basic preprocessing.
- **Power BI:** Leveraged for advanced data visualization, dashboard creation, and in-depth analysis.
- **SQL Server:** Employed for data extraction, transformation, and storage, ensuring a robust and reliable foundation for analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Before analysis, the data underwent a thorough cleaning process to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency. SQL Server was utilized to preprocess the data and create a structured dataset suitable for analysis in Power BI.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Excel and Power BI to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. Explored key metrics, identified patterns, and visualized initial trends to guide subsequent analysis.

## Data Analysis
Utilized Power BI's advanced features to perform in-depth analysis of pizza sales data. Employed SQL queries within Power BI to extract and transform data, creating interactive dashboards that showcase sales metrics, customer preferences, and regional variations.

## Results/Findings
The analysis revealed valuable findings, including top-selling pizza varieties, peak sales periods, and regional preferences. Visualizations in Power BI provide a clear representation of the data, facilitating easy interpretation and communication of results.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the project offers recommendations for strategic decisions to optimize pizza sales. These may include targeted marketing strategies, inventory adjustments, and regional promotional campaigns.

## Limitations
It's important to acknowledge the limitations of the analysis, such as potential biases in the dataset, the scope of available variables, and the generalizability of findings. These limitations provide context for interpreting the results.
